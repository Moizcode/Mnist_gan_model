# GAN Number Generator

This repository contains a GAN model that generates numbers between 0 to 9 using the MNIST dataset.

## Project Overview
The GAN model consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator, which compete against each other to improve their performance. The generator creates images of handwritten digits, and the discriminator evaluates their authenticity.

## Technical Details
- **Dataset**: MNIST
- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)
- **Epochs**: 200

## Results
The model successfully learned to generate realistic digits after training for 200 epochs.
